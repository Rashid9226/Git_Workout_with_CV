"""Affine transformation
An affine transformation matrix(say 2*3) for 2D transformations is of the form:
[[a,b,tx],[c,d,ty]]
if a=10,b=25 and tx=100 then :
    a=10: This value will scale the x-coordinates of the image by a factor of 10.
    This means the image will be stretched horizontally by a factor of 10.
    -Makes the image 10 times wider (horizontal stretch).
    
    
    b=25: This value introduces a shear effect in the x-direction. Each pixel's 
    x-coordinate will be affected by its y-coordinate scaled by 25, creating a skewed effect.
    -Tilts (skews) the image, making it slant horizontally based on its vertical position.
    
    tx=100: This translates the image 100 pixels to the right.

also if c=30,d=50,ty=100 means
    c = 30: Tilts (skews,shear) the image, making it slant vertically based on its horizontal position.
    d = 50: Makes the image 50 times taller (vertical stretch).
    ty = 100: Moves the image 100 pixels down.
    
Horizontal Stretching and Skewing: The image gets wider and tilts based on its height.
Vertical Stretching and Skewing: The image gets taller and tilts based on its width.
Translation: The entire image moves to the right and down.
